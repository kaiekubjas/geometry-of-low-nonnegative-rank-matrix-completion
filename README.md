This repository contains code for the article ''Geometry of low nonnegative rank matrix completion" by Kaie Kubjas and Lilja Metsälampi. All of the provided code is for the software Mathematica.

## File descriptions

- The mathematica file `one_missing_entry_rank-3_nonnegative_rank-4.nb` contains the computations for the geometric algorithm used in Example 4.7.
- The Mathematica file `11_21_counter_example.nb` contains computations used in Example 5.7 to provide an example of a partial matrix with the entries (1,1) and (2,1) missing with no nonnegative rank-3 completions along with code for making the figures.
- The Mathematica file `11_22_counter_example.nb` contains computations used in Example 5.9 to provide an example of a partial matrix with the entries (1,1) and (2,2) missing with no nonnegative rank-3 completions along with code for making the figures.
